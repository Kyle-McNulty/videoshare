# Videoshare
Share videos, together.

We are designing a media share application in the form of a web app using firebase storage. The app will allow users to upload video clips up to a certain size limit and also view other users' videos. We also plan on implementing features such as favorites, likes and friends. It will be similar to YouTube, except it will be centered on a particular theme like "action sports" or likewise. This will also be good practice for what we have learned this quarter as well as a test of our coding abilities.


# Technology
Some of the technology we will use includes:

1) Firebase: We will use the firebase authentication (similar to what we used on our previous challenge) as well as firebase storage, which will handle the uploading of media objects

2) Frameworks: Although we have not commited to one framework, it is likely we will take advantage of the Bootstrap or Material Design Lite framework to expedite the UI / UX portion of our final project. Our design will be simple and clean, emphasizing the media that the user will contribute.

3) Responsivity: We will make the website as responsive as possible and will support viewing of personal and other user's media objects on a broad range of devices including desktop and mobile. This is necessary to accomodate the many users that are migrating the mobile devices.

4) While we have an idea of what we need to accomplish for this, we may have to use certain APIs like the File API or Blobs API to accomplish this. As we do more research in the coming days, we will narrow our focus on what we need to research and learn to properly execute our plan
